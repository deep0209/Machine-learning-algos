# Machine-learning-algos

AdalineGD is a class to perform neural network binary classification using Python and following libraries:

Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib

This model can be easily extended to perform multi-class classification problem (One-vs-Rest). 
Weights are updated based on linear activation function. Used 'standarization' feature scaling and various learning rates to minimize the cost function. 

The class can be optimized by passing learning rate and number of iterations.
